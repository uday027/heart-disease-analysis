# 💖 Heart Disease Data Analytics Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset to uncover insights into risk factors, gender-based prevalence, and disease severity trends.  
Using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, I performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to highlight patterns that contribute to heart disease.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- **Gender & Heart Disease** → Males show a higher percentage of heart disease cases compared to females.  
- **Chest Pain Types** → Specific chest pain types are strongly associated with higher severity.  
- **Cholesterol & BP** → Patients with high cholesterol and elevated blood pressure are more likely to develop severe heart conditions.  
- **ST Depression (ECG)** → Higher ST depression levels are linked with severe disease stages.  
- **Age Factor** → Middle-aged and senior groups show higher prevalence compared to younger patients.  

## 📊 Visualizations  
- Bar Chart → Heart disease prevalence by gender  
- Pie Charts → Male vs Female chest pain type distribution  
- Histograms & KDE → Cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate distributions  
- Correlation Heatmap → Relationship among risk factors  
- Grouped Bar Chart → Average risk factor values across disease severity

🎯 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis (EDA) on medical datasets can uncover meaningful patterns in patient health data. The findings highlight gender differences, critical risk factor trends, and disease severity progression, offering actionable insights for clinicians and researchers. These insights provide a strong foundation for future predictive modeling, early detection systems, and data-driven healthcare decision-making.
